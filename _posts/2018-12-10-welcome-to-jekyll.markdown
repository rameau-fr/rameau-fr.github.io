I am **Francois Rameau**, an Assistant Professor at the [State University of New York (SUNY)](https://www.sunykorea.ac.kr/) in Korea. I earned my Ph.D. in Vision and Robotics from the [University of Burgundy](https://en.u-bourgogne.fr/), France, in 2014, supervised by Professors [Cedric Demonceaux](http://vibot.cnrs.fr/ceacutedric-demonceaux.html), [Desire Sidibe](https://sites.google.com/view/dsidibe/), and [David Fofi](http://www.davidfofi.net/). Before my Ph.D., I obtained my Master degree in Vision and Robotics ([VIBOT](https://www.vibot.org/), Erasmus mundus) from the [University of Burgundy](https://en.u-bourgogne.fr/) in 2011.
Post-Ph.D., I joined the [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](https://www.kaist.ac.kr) as a postdoctoral researcher. Today, I continue my journey with KAIST as an Associate Research Professor in the [Robotics and Computer Vision (RCV) laboratory](http://rcv.kaist.ac.kr/).
My research interests encompass 3D Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Collaborative Robotics. I'm passionate about creating innovative computer vision and machine learning strategies for connected and autonomous driving, and fundamental computer vision topics such as visual tracking, camera calibration, and 3D reconstruction.
I've had the privilege of presenting my work at various venues in fields like machine learning (AAAI, ICLR), robotics (IROS, ICRA, RSS), computer vision (ICCV, ECCV, CVPR, PAMI, IJCV, CVIU), augmented reality (ISMAR, TVCG), intelligent vehicle (IV), and multimedia (ACMM).
