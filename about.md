I received my Master degree in Vision and Robotics ([VIBOT](https://www.vibot.org/), Erasmus mundus) from the [University of Burgundy](https://en.u-bourgogne.fr/) in 2011. I completed my PhD degree in December 2014 under the joined supervision of Prof. [David Fofi](http://www.davidfofi.net/), Prof. [Cedric Demonceaux](http://vibot.cnrs.fr/ceacutedric-demonceaux.html) and Prof. [Desire Sidibe](https://sites.google.com/view/dsidibe/). In 2015, I worked as a full time postdoctoral researcher in KAIST (Daejeon, South Korea). I am nowadays an Associate Research Professor in the [Robotics and Computer Vision (RCV) laboratory](http://rcv.kaist.ac.kr/) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr).
